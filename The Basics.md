Gameplay in the world follows a very basic formula of collaborative storytelling:
1. The Game Master (GM) describes the scene.
2. The Players describe what actions they wish to take.
3. The GM determines and describes the outcome.

Many of the game's rules deal with step 3 above, and describe how to determine uncertain outcomes (commonly through dice rolling). 

Depending on the circumstances, different rules apply. For the most important rules see:
* [[Ability Tests]]
* [[Overland Travel and Survival]]
* [[Dungeon Travel and Survival]]

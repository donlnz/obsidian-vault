## Surprise and Initiative

## Attacking

## Damage

## Critical Hits

## Poison
Some foes, e.g. venomous snakes, may deal their damage as poison. Damage dealth depends on the strength of the monster (nominally 1d6 per HD). A character affected hit by a poisonous attack can attempt a save vs. poison to take only halved damage.

## Death
When a character or creature is hit, the amount of damage is deducted from his or her hit points. When hit points reach 0, the character is unconscious and will continue to lose one hit point per round from blood loss until death occurs at –10 hp. Any additional damage suffered by an unconscious character (aside from bleeding) will kill them instantly. The blood loss of 1 hit point per round may be stopped immediately in the same round that aid of some kind is administered to the wounded character. Being knocked unconscious is quite serious; even after returning to 1 or more hp (by means of a healing spell, potion, or natural rest) the character will remain in a coma for 1-6 turns and must rest for a minimum of one week before he or she will be capable of resuming any sort of strenuous activity, mental or physical. If a character is reduced to –6 hit points or below, the scars of the wound will likely be borne for the rest of the character’s life.

Alternative: When a character is reduced to 0 HP, their MAX HP is reduced by the "spill over" damage.  If MAX HP is 0, the character dies.

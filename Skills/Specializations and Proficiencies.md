Skills are divided into two main categories: specializations and proficiencies. Specializations describe skills that any character could attempt, but at a disadvantage if they are not trained in the task. Proficiencies describe skills that require some amount of training to even attempt, and years of studying to fully master.

## Specializations
While any character can be assumed to have some amount of aptitude at basic tasks like running, counting, etc., some tasks are better represented by specialized skills that assume that the character has some amount of training or practice. For instance, no matter how dextrous, it is quite unlikely that a character would be successful in picking a lock without some prior training.

Any character may attempt to perform tasks relating to these specializations, however, if they are not trained in the skill they must do so at a disadvantage (roll 2d20 and choose the lower result). If specialized in the task, however, the character may attempt it as normal, with a 1d20 roll (adding the relevant character ability modifier).

\*\*\* Setting and disarming traps.


### Improving Specializations
Through experience and training, a character may hone their abilities in these specializations. Each level of specialization beyond the first provides an additional +1 modifier to the 1d20 roll.

The primary methods of gaining specialization levels are:
1. On gaining a level, a character may increase one of their existing specializations by a single level if the specialization skill has been used (either successfully or unsucessfully) at least five times since last gaining a level.
2. Studying, either with the help of a learned master or from other appropriate sources (e.g. litterature). Of course, first you'll have to find yourself a teacher or a set of books, as well as secure the gold for payment. Studying is the only means with which to aquire new specializations.

A character can at most attain 5 levels of specialization in any skill (for a +4 bonus), representing mastery of the skill. Remember, a master can still fail.

### Specialization Bonus
| Specialization Level | Bonus |
| - | - |
| 0 (Untrained) | Disadvantage |
|1 | +0 |
| 2 | +1 |
| 3 | +2 |
| 4 | +3 |
| 5 | + 4|

## Proficiencies
Proficiencies are skills that, generally, are associated with some type of profession. 

| Specialization | Character Ability | 
|:--------------:|:-----------------:|
| Alchemy | INT | 
| Arcanology | INT | 
| Astronomy | INT | 
| Botany | INT | 
| Craft ✝ | INT | 
| Engineering | INT | 
| Geography | INT | 
| Geology | INT | 
| Medicine | WIS | 
| Navigation (Sea) | WIS | 
| Navigation (Underground) | WIS | 
| Instrument ✝ | CHR | 
| Reading & Writing | INT | 
| Religion | WIS | 
| History | WIS | 
| Zoology | INT | 

The ✝-symbol indicates that the specialization needs to be further specified, i.e., that the player must choose a specific craft (blacksmithing, leatherworking, etc.), or a specific instrument (harp, lyre, etc.) to be specialized in.

### Descriptions
Like specializations, proficiencies range from level 0 (untrained) to level 5 (mastery). Unlike specializations, however:
1. A character can not use a proficiency skill in which they do not have at least level 1.
2. Rather than providing flat d20 modifiers, higher proficiency levels provide more varied bonuses describing the character's improved professional abilities. For detailed descriptions, see [[Proficiency Descriptions]].

### Improving Proficiencies
Improving (or gaining) proficiencies can only be done by studying. Compared to specializations, finding the proper teacher or studying materials is more difficult, and hiring them is significantly more expensive.

#### Specialization Tokens
Each character starts with their choice of 3 specializations (or, 2 specializations and 1 proficiency). It is, however, not necessary to determine the character's specializations on creation. A player has access to 3 tokens that can be redeemed at any time, to give their character a new specialization (or proficiency, if applicable). The only requirement to redeem a Specialization Token is that the player is able to describe how their character came to be specialized in the chosen skill.

> ##### Example
> Runar needs to heal his injured friend's wounds. Runar's player dislikes their odds with a -2 WIS bonus and a disadvantage penalty to First Aid, and decides to redeem a Specialization Token. Runar's player explains that Runar's mother, who was drafted into the Sisters of Salvation, taught him basic medicine during his childhood.

## Languages

It is assumed that most civilized people (humans, halflings, dwarves, elves, gnomes) speak Common—a neutral language spoken by most citizens of Faerûn. Other characters, including goblins, orcs, dragons and demons, may or may not be able to speak Common. Other languages that exist in the world include Elvish, Dwarvish, Goblin, Orcish, Gnoll, Draconic, Demonic, Druidic, Thieves' Cant (spoken by the thieves' guilds), Undercommon (spoken in the Underdark), and Faerie (spoken in the Feywild).

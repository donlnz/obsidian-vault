While any character can be assumed to have some amount of aptitude at Basic Tasks like climbing, running, counting, etc., some tasks are better represented by specialized skills that assume that the character has some amount of training or practice. For instance, no matter how intelligent, it is very unlikely that a character would be successful at potion brewing—a task that requires deep alchemical knowledge. Some examples of specializations are listed below.

##### Specializations
| Specialization | Character Ability | Untrained |
|:--------------:|:-----------------:|:---------:|
| Alchemy | INT | - |
| Animal Handling | INT | -6 |
| Appraisal | INT | -6 |
| Arcanology | INT | - |
| Astronomy | INT | - |
| Bartering | CHR | -6 |
| Botany | INT | -6 |
| Cooking | WIS | -3 |
| Craft ✝ | INT | - |
| Engineering | INT | - |
| Fishing | WIS | -6 |
| Foraging | WIS | -6 |
| Forgery | INT | - |
| Geography | INT | - |
| Geology | INT | - |
| Hunting | WIS | -6 |
| Medicine | WIS | -6 |
| Navigation (Land) | WIS | -3 |
| Navigation (Sea) | WIS | - |
| Navigation (Underground) | WIS | -9 |
| Instrument ✝ | CHR | - |
| Reading & Writing | INT | -9 |
| Religion | WIS | -3 |

The ✝-symbol indicates that the specialization needs to be further specified, i.e., that the player must choose a specific craft (blacksmithing, leatherworking, etc.), or a specific instrument (Harp, Lyre, etc.) to be specialized in.

The main purpose of specializations is to represent skills and abilities that the characters can learn and improve on over time. For example, a character deeply interested in botany may seek out teachers and literature that can help them improve their botanic knowledge (resulting, for instance, in an improved ability to identify wild plants).

Like Basic Tasks, some specializations (e.g. Bartering and Cooking) are accessible even to untrained characters, but at a penalty. A character not trained in cooking is still able to attempt to prepare a meal, but with a decreased chance of success. The Untrained column in the list of specializations provides the penalty applied to any roll made by a character not trained in the specified skill. If no penalty is provided, that means a character cannot attempt the task without training. The character's Ability Bonuses apply (determined by the Character Ability column) regardless of whether the character is trained or untrained in the specialization skill. If the character is trained, the Untrained penalty is ignored.

> ##### Example 1
> Leofald is attempting to brew a potion of healing. He is trained in alchemy, and has an INT score of 16, giving him an INT bonus of +2. GM determines that healing potion brewing is a task of Average difficulty for an alchemist, and sets the Target Value to 10. Leofald rolls 9 on a d20, and applies his +2 INT bonus to the roll, giving a final result of 11. GM concludes that Leofald successfully brews a potion of healing.

>  ##### Example 2
> Burnek wants to forage for rations during the party's travel through a tundra region. He is not trained in foraging, giving him a -6 penalty to his roll. Burnek's WIS score of 13 gives him a WIS bonus of +1 on the roll, resulting in a total bonus (penalty) of -5. GM determines that foraging in the tundra is a Difficult task and sets the Target number to 15. Burnek rolls a 17, resulting in a total of 12 after applying the -5 penalty. GM concludes that Burnek's foraging attempt is unsuccessful.

#### Specialization Tokens
Each character starts with their choice of 3 specializations, however, it is not necessary to determine the character's specializations on creation. A player has access to 3 tokens that can be redeemed at any time, to give their character a new specialization. The only requirement to redeem a Specialization Token is that the player is able to describe how their character came to be specialized in the chosen skill.

> ##### Example
> Runar needs to heal his injured friend's wounds. Runar's player dislikes their odds with a -2 WIS bonus and a -6 Untrained penalty to Medicine, and decides to redeem a Specialization Token. Runar's player explains that Runar's mother was drafted into the Sisters of Salvation, taught him basic medicine during his childhood.

## Languages

It is assumed that most civilized people (humans, halflings, dwarves, elves, gnomes) speak Common—a neutral language spoken by most citizens of Faerûn. Other characters, including goblins, orcs, dragons and demons, may or may not be able to speak Common. Other languages that exist in the world include Elvish, Dwarvish, Goblin, Orcish, Gnoll, Draconic, Demonic, Druidic, Thieves' Cant (spoken by the thieves' guilds), Undercommon (spoken in the Underdark), and Faerie (spoken in the Feywild).

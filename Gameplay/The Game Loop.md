Gameplay in the world follows a very basic formula of collaborative storytelling:
1. The Game Master (GM) describes the scene.
2. The Players describe what actions they wish to take.
3. The GM determines and describes the outcome.

Most of the rules of the game deal with step 3 above, and describe how to determine uncertain outcomes (commonly through dice rolling). Determining outcomes relies on a few different subsystems within the game rules, the most important of which are outlined here.

## Abiliy Tests
Each character possesses a set of basic **Character Abilities**: Strength (STR), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), and Charisma (CHR). These describe the character's aptitude at solving basic tasks such as moving heavy objects, or climbing ropes.

Attempting a **Basic Task** (a task that any person could reasonably attempt without any special training) requires an **Ability Test** that decides the outcome (success or failure). The GM (secretly) determines the difficulty of the task (e.g., Easy or Very Difficult), and sets a target number that the character needs to beat (roll over) on a twenty-sided die (**1d20**). The outcome is then determined based on the player's roll (after adding relevating modifiers), with a result equal to or higher than the target number resulting in success, and any result lower than the target number resulting in failure.

##### Ability Test Targets
| Difficulty | Target Number |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Trivial | Automatic Success
|Easy | 5 |
|Average | 10 |
|Difficult | 15 |
|Very difficult | 20 |
|Impossible | Automatic Failure |

In addition to determining the difficulty, the GM also determines which of the six Character Abilities that is relevant for the task. For example, moving a moderately heavy bolder might require an Average STR test, whereas balancing on a thin beam might require a Very Difficult DEX test. The character's Character Abilities provide bonuses (or penalties) that are added to (or subtracted from) the **1d20** roll made by the player, according to the chart on the next page.

##### Ability Bonuses
| Ability Score | Ability Bonus |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|3 | -3|
|4-5 | -2 |
|6-8 | -1 |
|9-12 | 0 |
|13-15 | +1 |
|16-17 | +2 |
|18 | +3 |
| 19 | +4 |

> ##### Example
> Weylen is hanging from a cliff ledge, and wants to hoist herself up. The GM determines that this is a Difficult STR task, and asks Weylen to roll a d20 and add her STR bonus. Weylen rolls a 14 and adds her +1 STR bonus (based on her STR score of 13), for a total of 15. GM describes how Weylen just barely manages to pull herself over the cliff ledge and reach safety.


### Death

A character that reaches 0 health points is knocked down and incapacitated, and cannot take any actions during combat. If a character reaches -10 health points, they die.

Each character possesses a set of basic **Character Abilities**: Strength (STR), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), and Charisma (CHR). These describe the character's aptitude at solving basic tasks such as moving heavy objects, or climbing ropes.

Attempting a **Basic Task** (a task that any person could reasonably attempt without any special training) requires an **Ability Test** that decides the outcome (success or failure).

Ability Tests are normally determined in one of three ways:
1. If the task attempted is consirered trivial, success is automatic.
2. If the task attempted is consirered impossible, failure is automatic.
3. If the task attempted is considered of average difficulty, a d20 die roll determines the outcome.

In case 3, the GM determines which character ability best matches the task attempted; e.g., lifting a heavy portcullis likely requires strength (STR) and dodging a falling boulder likely requires dexterity (DEX). In these cases, the player will be asked to roll a 20-sided die (1d20). A roll showing a result less than (or equal to) the player character's relevant ability score results in a success, whereas a die showing a number greater than the character's abilty score results in a failure. **Example:** Grognard the barbarian (STR 17) wants to throw his backpack across a 10-meters-wide pit. The GM determines that this is a task of average difficulty, and Grognard's player rolls 1d20. With a result of 12 (less than or equal to Grognard's strength score of 17), Grognard succeeds in his task.

If the task attempted is considered particularly easy or difficult, the GM might additionally announce a specific penalty or bonus to the roll. For example, flipping a tavern table (STR) might be accompanied with a small bonus (e.g. -5 to the 1d20 roll) if performed during a testosterone-filled tavern brawl where the player character is particularly enraged, whereas scaling the outer wall of a guard tower (DEX) might incur a heavy penalty (e.g. +10 to the 1d20 roll) if the tower is constructed from smooth stone rather than bricks.

| Difficulty | Typical Bonus (-to 1d20 roll) |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|Trivial | Automatic Success |
|Easy | -5 |
|Average | 0 |
|Difficult | +5 |
|Very difficult | +10 |
|Impossible | Automatic Failure |

In addition to determining the difficulty, the GM also determines which of the six Character Abilities that is relevant for the task. For example, moving a moderately heavy bolder might require an Average STR test, whereas balancing on a thin beam might require a Very Difficult DEX test. The character's Character Abilities provide bonuses (or penalties) that are added to (or subtracted from) the **1d20** roll made by the player, according to the chart on the next page.

##### Ability Bonuses
| Ability Score | Ability Modifier |
| :-------------: | :-------------: |
| 3 | - 3 | 
| 4-5 | -2 |
| 6-8 | -1 |
| 9-12 | 0 |
| 13-15 | +1 |
| 16-17 | +2 |
| 18 | +3 |
| 19 | +4 |

### Death

A character that reaches 0 health points is knocked down and incapacitated, and cannot take any actions during combat. If a character reaches -10 health points, they die.

A player may choose to create a character with multiple classes, so-called multi-classing.

When choosing to play a multi-class character:
* For starting health, roll both HD and add CON bonus for both. Divide the result with the number of classes (rounded down).
* All experience points gained are split evenly among the character's classes.
* Each time the character gains a level in any class, divide their maximum HP increase by the number of classes.
* To calculate saving throws, simply take the average (including any bonuses) of all character classes.

Special notes:
* A Fighter/Cleric is allowed to use edged weapons.
* A Scoundrel/X always gets disadvantage on Skullduggery rolls if wearing armor heavier than leather.
* A Ranger/X always gets disadvantage on Survival rolls if wearing armor heavier than leather.
